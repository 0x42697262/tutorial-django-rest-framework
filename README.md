# Django REST Framework Tutorial
I followed the [official documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

To get started, do a `pip install pip-tools` first in your virtual environment then install the required packages with `pip-sync <project name>/requirements/base.txt`. You can then start creating a Django project with `django-admin startproject <project name>`.

I will be separating my Django projects into directories.
